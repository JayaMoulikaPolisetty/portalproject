			Features
			 Wikis 
			GitHub Wikis is a simple way to let others contribute content. Any GitHub user can create and edit pages to use for documentation, examples, support, or anything you wish.

			Restrict editing to collaborators only 
			Public wikis will still be readable by everyone.

			Issues 
			GitHub Issues adds lightweight issue tracking tightly integrated with your repository. Add issues to milestones, label issues, and close & reference issues from commit messages.

			Projects 
			Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.

			Data services
			Use the data from your repository to power these enhanced features.

			Vulnerability alerts 
			Receive alerts for known security vulnerablities found in dependencies.
